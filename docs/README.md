# OctoAcme Project Management Process Documentation

## Overview

This documentation repository contains OctoAcme's comprehensive project management framework, designed to standardize how we plan, execute, and deliver cross-functional projects. These processes help teams deliver customer value efficiently while maintaining high quality, clear communication, and continuous improvement.

### Our Philosophy

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on five core principles:

1. **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
2. **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to reduce risk and gather feedback
3. **Clear ownership**: Each project has named accountability for success
4. **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
5. **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

## Summary of Project Management Processes

Our project management lifecycle follows a structured yet flexible approach that adapts to project needs:

### 1. **Project Initiation**
Define the problem, validate business need, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight project charter. This phase ensures we're solving the right problem before investing significant resources.

### 2. **Project Planning**
Transform approved initiatives into actionable plans with prioritized backlogs, clear acceptance criteria, and identified dependencies. Planning establishes how we'll deliver value incrementally.

### 3. **Execution & Tracking**
Manage day-to-day delivery with consistent team rhythms, quality standards, and progress tracking. This phase focuses on building, testing, and iterating toward milestones.

### 4. **Release & Deployment**
Safely deliver features to production with standardized deployment processes, rollback plans, and verification steps to minimize risk.

### 5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**
Capture learnings after sprints, releases, or incidents and convert them into actionable improvements that enhance future delivery.

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **Roles & Personas**: Clear definition of responsibilities for Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers, QA, and Stakeholders
- **Risk Management & Communication**: Proactive identification and mitigation of risks with transparent stakeholder communication

- Add relevant process documents to your project's `.copilot/` directory to provide context for Copilot Spaces
- Copilot can help generate project artifacts (charters, risk registers, etc.) based on these templates
- Use these docs as institutional knowledge to scale best practices across teams

## Key Artifacts and Templates

Throughout these documents, you'll find templates for:
- Project One-pager / Charter
- Backlog Item specifications
- Risk Register
- Sprint Planning
- Release Notes
- Status Updates
- Retrospective Action Items

## Communication Cadence

Standard communication rhythms across projects:
- **Daily**: Team standups (15 min)
- **Twice Weekly**: Delivery team syncs (as agreed)
- **Weekly**: PM + Product Manager alignment
- **Weekly**: Risk register updates
- **Monthly**: Stakeholder updates
- **As Needed**: Escalations and incident response
